# 🌟 Random Quote Generator  

This is a simple **Random Quote Generator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The project provides three different ways to generate quotes:  
1. **Using an API** – Fetches quotes dynamically from an online source.  
2. **Using a JSON file** – Loads quotes from a local JSON file.  
3. **Using an Object Array** – Predefined quotes stored inside a JavaScript script.  

The project offers a fun and interactive way to get inspired by random quotes, along with features that allow users to easily copy quotes or share them on social media platforms.
